# Spiral Console Application Skeleton [![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/spiral/app-cli/version)](https://packagist.org/packages/spiral/app-cli)

Spiral Framework is a High-Performance PHP/Go Full-Stack framework and group of over sixty PSR-compatible components. The Framework execution model based on a hybrid runtime where some services (GRPC, Queue, WebSockets, etc.) handled by Application Server [RoadRunner](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner) and the PHP code of your application stays in memory permanently (anti-memory leak tools included).
